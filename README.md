Association Rule Mining, or Association Rule Learning, is a technique used to find associations between variables.
An example is Amazon knowing what you want to buy when you visit their site, 
Spotify knows what song you want to listen to enxt. 

In contrast, Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, 
You are more or less likely to buy another group of items.
"For example, if you are in an English pub and you buy a pint of beer and don’t buy a bar meal, 
you are more likely to buy crisps at the same time than somebody who didn’t buy beer."
